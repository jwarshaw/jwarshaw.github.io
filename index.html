		Website Example: http://www.sheldonbrown.com/frame-sizing.html
		Sheldon Brown authored THE cycling website so I referenced his work for my project.
		
		The Good: Sheldon's site is full of incredibly useful information and the layout is simple making for a very readable page. Additionally, he makes great use of <a href=""> linking to other related pages on his site, in particular the bicycle gloassary. Needless to say it is easy to spend too much time on his site.
		
		The Bad: The site sorely lacks visuals to compliment the articles. An <img> element here and there would not go amiss. He uses the <div> element as his default organization tool rather than other options like <section> when applicable. His site is chock full of useful articles that can be very hard to find (unless you know exactly what to look for) because there are no navigation links. THe best way to search his site is Google so if you want to read about some aspect of cycling but don't have the vocabulary to reference it you are out of luck.

	<h1>Riding High</h1>

	<section>
		<h2>The Problem</h2>
		<p>Last year I bought a 2005 KHS Flite 300, an entry level road bike, on CL. I spent months searching. It was in excellent condition. It rode fast. The price was right. Perfect. Or so I thought. As I went on longer and more frequent rides I began to develop shoulder pain. I adjusted the seat. Still discomfort. The stem. No change. Added handlebar pads. Nothing. Before I bought the bike I researched sizes and determined, based on my height (5'10"), that a 56cm frame would be the right fit. I used a table like <a href="table.html">this</a>. After further research, prompted by my riding pains, this method turned out to be a naive approach to sizing. I read up on bike fit and learned that it is a common problem among road cyclists. A better approach is to use a fit tool like <a href="http://www.competitivecyclist.com/Store/catalog/fitCalculatorBike.jsp">this</a> from Competitive Cyclist. I also found the source of my problem: my body proportions are not exactly average.</p>

		<h2>The Proportions</h2>
		<p>My limbs are long relative to my height. Or you might say my torso is short. I prefer the former. A typical bike frame is built such that the size indicates both the length of the seat tube and the length of the top tube (if you don't know your bike parts check out the diagram below). I am built such that this way of building bikes sucks for me. When I selected a 56cm bike I was half right. The bottom half. My legs which align with the seat tube fit a 56cm frame. My torso which aligns with the top tube fits a 53cm frame. My 56cm KHS is pulling my shoulders too far forward causing upper back pain. A tall and narrow bike is what I need. These are hard to find and custom build would break the bank. My options are limited, but I have a plan!</p>

		<h2>The Plan</h2>
		<p>According to some randos on the internet, the top tube length is the main determinant for riding comfort. 
		This (let's call it a)fact in combination with the idea that one can relatively easily "add" height and width to a frame via the seatpost and stem, form the basis of the plan. Here is the plan. I will purchase a 53cm bike on CL for cheapsies and install a long seat post and a long quill stem, effectively adding the height my legs require. Please see the very professional technical mock-up below if you are more of a visual learner.</p>

		<h2>The ePilogue</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Will this build ride top heavy? Maybe.</li> 
			<li>Will I look like a stilt walker on a Razor scooter? Perhaps.</li>
			<li>Will my shoulders scream mercy if I ride more than 30 minutes? Nope! Well, I hope not. I really hope this works.</li>
		</ul>
